# CreatorsHub Specs & SDK

**Manifesto:** Creators own their rails. Data is portable. Access is programmable.  
This repo is the **public surface**: specs, docs, and SDK/examples. No secrets.

## What’s here
- `docs/API.md` – draft API surface (evolves with the product).
- `docs/DATA_PORTABILITY.md` – our policy for export & interoperability.
- `sdk/js/` – minimal JavaScript/TypeScript SDK scaffold.
- `examples/node/basic.js` – quick-start example.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE` – project hygiene.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
node examples/node/basic.js
```

## Philosophy (short)
- **Open**: protocols, formats, and SDKs are public by default.
- **Portable**: creators can export everything and leave – and still choose to stay.
- **Moat**: experience, support, partners, and CreatorPass reputation – not secrets.
