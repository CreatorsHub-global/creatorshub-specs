# Data Portability Statement

CreatorsHub commits to **full export** and **interoperability**:
- **Export All**: creators can export media + metadata + relationships (JSON + assets).
- **APIs**: public endpoints to programmatically export and migrate.
- **On-chain**: access/ownership should live on-chain where it matters; off-chain mirrors stay in sync.
- **Granularity**: export by collection, by time range, or full account.
- **No dark patterns**: exports are discoverable, documented, and fast.
- **Security**: exports require strong auth; signed URLs expire; PII is minimized.
- **Rate-limits**: fair use to protect the platform and other users.
- **Compatibility**: open, well-documented schemas.

We believe the moat is **experience, network, and CreatorPass** â€“ not lock-in.
